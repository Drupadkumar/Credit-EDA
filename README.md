# Credit-EDA
**Problem Statement:**  
The company faces significant challenges in extending loans to customers with insufficient or no credit history, which increases the risk of defaults. The key risks are:  

1. **Business Loss:** Rejecting creditworthy applicants results in missed opportunities.  
2. **Financial Loss:** Approving loans for high-risk applicants who default leads to financial setbacks.  

The goal is to identify patterns in loan applications to assess the likelihood of customer default. This will enable the company to make informed decisions on loan approvals, minimizing risks and ensuring loans are granted only to suitable applicants, thereby safeguarding the business from potential losses.  

**Business Objectives:**  
The primary objective is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in consumer and loan data that predict the likelihood of loan default. This analysis will guide the company in:  

- Denying loans to applicants identified as high risk.  
- Offering reduced loan amounts to customers with elevated risk.  
- Charging higher interest rates to applicants more likely to default.  
- Ensuring creditworthy applicants are not unjustly denied loans.  

By identifying the factors influencing loan default, the company can enhance its risk assessment processes, improve its loan portfolio quality, and make more effective financial decisions.
