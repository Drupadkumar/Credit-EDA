# Loan Default Risk Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis Project
## Problem

Financial institutions face significant losses when borrowers fail to repay loans.
To improve lending decisions, it is critical to understand:

* Which financial, demographic, and credit-related factors influence loan default

* How risk varies across customer segments

* What patterns indicate potential default behaviour

The objective was to analyze applicant data to uncover meaningful trends that support better credit assessment and risk management.

## Solution

A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to identify drivers of loan default:

1. Data Exploration

* Examined applicant income, loan amount, credit history, employment, and demographic attributes

* Studied distribution, outliers, and missing values

* Compared characteristics of default vs. non-default customers

2. Visual Pattern Detection

* Created correlation heatmaps to identify key relationships

* Used bar plots, box plots, and trend charts for risk segmentation

* Analyzed how credit history, income stability, debt levels, and past defaults impact risk

3. Risk Segmentation

* Grouped customers into low, medium, and high-risk categories

* Identified factors strongly associated with default clusters

* Highlighted attributes that should be prioritized during loan approval

## Outcome

The analysis delivered:

* Clear insights into major default predictors, such as credit history, debt burden, loan amount, and income stability

* A decision-support framework to assist lenders in evaluating borrower risk

* Visual summaries that help stakeholders understand default behaviour patterns

* Actionable recommendations to reduce risk exposure and strengthen credit assessment workflows

This empowers financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions and minimize default losses.
